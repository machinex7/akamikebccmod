# akamikebccmod
A Cookie Clicker mod for fans of AkaMikeB!

This is still a WIP, so not everything it tested yet.

## Features
<b>V1</b>
* CPS and Clicking buff when Mike is streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/akamikeb">Twitch</a>.
* Achievements and Upgrades for catching live streams.

## Installation
### Steam App
Basically, you need to download the akamikebMod.js file and info.txt file and put them in your local mod directory. Here's the detailed instructions on how to do that.
1. Open the Cookie Clicker game, and go to the Options tab.
2. Click the Manage Mods button, all the way down at the bottom.
3. Click the Open /mods folder button.
4. Open the "local" directory and create a new folder, named "akamikeb".
5. Download <a href="/akamikebccmod/src/akamikebMod.js">akamikebMod.js</a> and <a href="/akamikebccmod/src/info.txt">info.txt</a> from the src directory of this repository.
6. Place the downloaded files in the newly created akamikeb folder.
7. In Cookie Clicker, close and re-open the Mod Manager. You should now see the AkaMikeB Mod.
8. Select it, then click the Enable button!

### Web Version
Much easier.
1. Drag this <a href="javascript: Game.LoadMod('https://machinex7.github.io/akamikebccmod/src/akamikebMod.js');">link</a> to your browser bookmark's bar.
2. When you're on the cookie clicker website, click the button!
